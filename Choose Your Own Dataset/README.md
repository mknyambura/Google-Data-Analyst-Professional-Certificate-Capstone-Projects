# Follow Your Own Case Study Path

# Introduction
Welcome to your very own case study! This is different from all the other cases in this course, as it gives you the opportunity to
choose a business question that is of particular interest to you. As a result, finding datasets and conducting analysis will be
more complex and will require you to make many decisions on your own.

## Scenario
You are a junior data analyst working for a business intelligence consultant. You have been at your job for six months, and your boss
feels you are ready for more responsibility. He has asked you to lead a project for a brand new client â€” this will involve everything
from defining the business task all the way through presenting your data-driven recommendations. You will choose the topic, ask
the right questions, identify a fresh dataset and ensure its integrity, conduct analysis, create compelling data visualizations, and
prepare a presentation

## Prepare
Find data that is appropriate for your analysis from any credible dataset. There are numerous public datasets that you can use. You
have already encountered some of them throughout this program:

   - Data about Amazon's bestselling books from 2009 to 2019, categorized into fiction and nonfiction.

Once you have decided on a dataset, gather and store the data appropriately, clean the data, and make sure it is reliable and
error-free. Document your process, as clients often ask to see both raw and cleaned data.
